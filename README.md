## About this Quickstart Guide
This is a quickstart guide to GitHub OAuth authentication using:
- Ruby
- The [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) web framework
- [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb) - a Ruby client for the GitHub [REST API](https://github.com.) (makes interacting with GitHub data easier)

To demonstrate the OAuth process, we're going to:
1) Set up a basic web server with Sinatra
2) Register a new OAuth Application on GitHub.com
3) Authenticate a user into our Sinatra app using GitHub's OAuth API
4) Use Octokit to retrieve this user's information from GitHub

## 1) Sinatra Webserver Setup
First, go ahead and clone the starter code from the [OAuth Ruby Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/github/OAuth-Ruby-Quickstart) repository.

This repository contains 3 files that we'll be working with:

`server.rb` - Our Sinatra webserver

`views/index.erb` - The webpage users will see before 'Signing in with GitHub'

`views/profile.erb` - The webpage users will see _after_ authenticating with GitHub OAuth. This page will display their profile photo, along with other user information

_P.S._([erb](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.1/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html) is a Ruby templating language which allows us to build HTML pages and pass in application data to be displayed on the page)


To fire up our webapp, open a terminal and run the following command from the project directory.
```
$ ruby server.rb 
```

You should see a message that **'Sinatra has taken the stage'**

We can now visit [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) to see our webpage.

You should see something like this:

![localhost:4567](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3988879/40741163-fee7adca-6407-11e8-9465-9cbdb2072286.png)

Our Sinatra app is up and running, but clicking that green **Sign In** button won't work yet. First, we need to register a new GitHub OAuth Application.


## 2) Register a new GitHub OAuth Application
Head on over to your [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) and register a new OAuth Application.

![screen shot 2018-05-25 at 4 23 36 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3988879/40568485-0f8fb498-6038-11e8-8405-25142babaac8.png)


You'll find the following fields:
**Application name** - This must be unique among all GitHub OAuth Applications.
**Homepage URL** - If you don't have a homepage for your application yet, just use your GitHub profile: `https://github.com/<YOUR_USER_NAME>` (don't forget the `https://`).
**Application description** - Explain to future users what this OAuth Application is used for.
**Authorization callback URL** - GitHub needs to know where to redirect users after a successful OAuth authorization. For this app, the user should be redirected to the `/profile` view in our `server.rb` file. Since we're still working locally, we can actually use the localhost url from step #1: `http://localhost:4567/profile`.


## 3) Authenticate a User with GitHubâ€™s OAuth API
Now for the fun stuff.

After registering your OAuth Application, you should see your Client ID and Client Secret. They'll look something like this:

![Client ID and Secret](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3988879/40741261-569e00d2-6408-11e8-96e4-3b454b5d7cbe.png)

Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into their respective places in the `server.rb` file.

Given the example above, the code would look like this:

![Client ID & Secret](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3988879/40741287-6c5267f6-6408-11e8-9d74-b5d1fe3f7232.png)

With that set up, we're ready to authenticate a user with GitHub's OAuth API.

With the Sinatra app running, go ahead and visit [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) again. This time, clicking the **Sign In with GitHub** button should take you to an authorization page:

![authorization](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3988879/40750372-4c5ae452-6424-11e8-8eda-67d03ca548fc.png)

This is where users grant your OAuth Application permission to access their data. As you can see, we're only requesting public data right now.

##### What happened here?
If you look at the URL in the address bar, you'll see your Client ID. On the previous page, the **Sign In with GitHub** button was in fact a link to an OAuth Authorization page, with your Client ID as a parameter. Sinatra built this link for us when we passed the `CLIENT_ID` into the index.erb template on line 24 of `server.rb`. Sinatra then interpolated our Client ID into the OAuth API link on line 15 of `index.erb`.

Go ahead and Authorize the Application access to your GitHub account data, and you should be redirected to your callback page: `/profile`.

![success](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3988879/40751094-f98ceea2-6426-11e8-915a-c44e0f38cfb6.png)

After a successful Application authorization, GitHub provides us with a temporary *authorization grant code* (see it in the URL up there?). We need to `POST` this code to the's `/login/oauth/access_token` endpoint to recieve an *access_token* The access token is what grants us access to the account data that we want to display.

To simplify the process of `POST`ing the authorization grant code back to GitHub, we'll use the [rest-client](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client) Ruby gem.

First, let's update our `/profile` view to retrieve the temporary authorization grant code. We'll use Sinatra's built in webserver interface, [Rack](https://rack.github.io/) to grab the code from the session data.

``` ruby
get '/profile' do
    # Retrieve temporary authorization grant code
    session_code = request.env['rack.request.query_hash']['code']
    
    erb :profile
end
```

Now that we have the authorization grant code, let's use `rest-client` to `POST` it back to GitHub along with our `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in exchange for our `access_token`.

The `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token` endpoint expects the following parameters:

Name | Type | Description
-- | -- | --
`client_id` | `string` | __Required.__ Your GitHub OAuth Application Client ID
`client_secret` | `string` | __Required.__ Your GitHub OAuth Application Client Secret
`code` | `string` | __Required.__ The authorization grant code returned after Application authorization


Let's also use the request header `:accept` to let the API know that we'd like a `JSON` formatted response.

``` ruby
get '/profile' do
    # Retrieve temporary authorization grant code
    session_code = request.env['rack.request.query_hash']['code']
    
    # POST Auth Grant Code + CLIENT_ID/SECRECT in exchange for our access_token
    response = RestClient.post('https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token',
                    # POST payload
                    {:client_id => CLIENT_ID
                    :client_secret => CLIENT_SECRET
                    :code => session_code},
                    # Request header for JSON response
                    :accept => :json)
    
    erb :profile
end
```

The API's response to our `POST` request will include the access token in a field called `access_token` in the `response` variable. Now we just need to parse out the access token.

``` ruby
    #Parse access_token from JSON response
    access_token = JSON.parse(response)['access_token']
```

## 4) Use Octokit to Access User Data

Now that we finally have our access token, we can start acessing user data via the GitHub API. Instead of manually calling / handling our own REST request / responses to the API, we can save some time and effort by using GitHub's official Ruby library, [Octokit](http://octokit.github.io/octokit.rb/).

First, we need initialize the Octokit client by passing it our access token `Octokit::Client.new(:access_token => access_token)`. After that, the user data associated with our `access_token` is available as `client.user`. We can now access any of the [user data properties](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-the-authenticated-user) available from the v3 REST API.

Here is the entire function, with the call to Octokit:

``` ruby
get '/profile' do
    # Retrieve temporary authorization grant code
    session_code = request.env['rack.request.query_hash']['code']
    
    # POST Auth Grant Code + CLIENT_ID/SECRECT in exchange for our access_token
    response = RestClient.post('https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token',
                    # POST payload
                    {:client_id => CLIENT_ID,
                    :client_secret => CLIENT_SECRET,
                    :code => session_code},
                    # Request header for JSON response
                    :accept => :json)
    
    # Parse access_token from JSON response
    access_token = JSON.parse(response)['access_token']
    
    # Initialize Octokit client with user access_token
    client = Octokit::Client.new(:access_token => access_token)
    
    # Create user object for less typing
    user = client.user
    
    # Access user data
    profile_data = {:user_photo_url => user.avatar_url,
                    :user_login => user.login,
                    :user_name => user.name,
                    :user_id => user.id }       
    
    # Render profile page, passing in user profile data to be displayed
    erb :profile, :locals => profile_data
end
```

All of the template [locals](http://sinatrarb.com/intro.html) we'd like to use are packaged up in `profile_data` and will be availble on the `profile.erb` page.

Now we just need to add in the erb partials in `profile.erb` to display the data.

``` html
<body>
    <div class="p-5">
        <div class="blankslate blankslate-narrow p-9">
            <img src="<%= user_photo_url %>" />
            <h3>
                Hey, <a href="<%= user_url %>">@<%= user_login %></a>!
            </h3>
            <p>
                You are GitHub user #<%= user_id %>
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray alt-text-small">
                Click <a href="https://api.github.com/users/<%= user_login %>">here</a> to see all of
                <br>your public profile data
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
```

The final result should look something like this:
<img width="969" alt="complete" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3988879/41005787-bc465d10-68d3-11e8-8b96-eac7b78de8dc.png">
